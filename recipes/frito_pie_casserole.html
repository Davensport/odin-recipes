        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground chuck</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 can red kidney beans</li>
            <li>1 can sweet whole kernal corn</li>
            <li>1 packet of taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>8 ounces of sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups corn chips</li>
            <li>sour cream, guacamole, and salsa, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground chuck, and cook, stirring and breaking up meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until browned and almost cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper; cook, stirring often, until beef is cooked through and onion is softened, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in stock, kidney beans, diced tomatoes, corn, taco seasoning, chipotle chile, and adobo sauce. Bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring often, until slightly thickened, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in 1 cup of the Cheddar.</li>
            <li>Transfer beef mixture to a 9 x 13-inch baking dish, and spread in an even layer. Top evenly with remaining Cheddar, and sprinkle evenly with corn chips.</li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until mixture is bubbling and Cheddar cheese is melted and starting to brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes. Garnish with scallions, and serve with sour cream, guacamole, and salsa.</li>           
        </ol>
